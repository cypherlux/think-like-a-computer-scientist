# Chapter 1 - General Introduction

## 1.1. The Way of the Program

Computer Scientists combine many different ways of thinking:
- _Mathmatics_ - use formal languages to denote ideas (specifically computations)
- _Engineering_ - design things, assembling compontents into systems and evaluating tradeoffs among alternative
- _Science_ - observe the behavior of complex systems, form hypotheses, and test predictions

__Problem Solving__ = ability to formulate problems, think creativity about solutions, and express a solution clearly and accurately.

## 1.2. Algorithms

_Algorithms_ are:
- SOLUTIONS
- a step-by-step list of instructions that if followed exactly will solve the problem under consideration

>Algorithms are like recipes: they must be followed exactly, they must be clear and unambiguous, and they must end.

Define problem -> design algorithm -> create and execute the solution

>Programming is a skill that allows a computer scientist to take an algorithm and represent it in a notation (a program) that can be followed by a computer.

Computers are used to automate solutions to problems WAY more faster and accurately compared to a human doing it by hand.

## 1.3. The Python Programming Language

Python is a __high-level__ programming language.

_High-level_ programming languages:
- take less time to write
- shorter and easier to read
- are __portable__ and can run on different kinds of computers

_Low-level_ programming languages:
- aka machine lanauges or assembly languages
- encode in binary so they can be __directly executed by the computer__

Two kinds of programs process high-level languages into low-level languages:
1) Interpreters
- executes the program directly
- processed a little at a time

2) Compilers
- reads program (source code) and translates it completely BEFORE it runs
